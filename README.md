# React Assignment Repository

Welcome to the React Assignment Repository! This repository contains a collection of React assignments that I solved during my learning journey. These assignments cover a range of difficulty levels, from basic to high, providing an opportunity for you to enhance your React skills.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Assignments:** Navigate to the `assignments` directory to explore the various assignments available.

2. **Choose an Assignment:** Each assignment has its own dedicated directory, named in a structured manner (e.g., `assignment-1`, `assignment-2`, etc.).

3. **Read the Question:** Inside each assignment directory, you will find a `README.md` file that outlines the specific problem statement or question for that assignment.

4. **Solve and Compare:** Try to solve the assignment on your own by following the instructions provided. After completing your solution, compare it with my solution in the corresponding `solution` directory within the assignment folder.

5. **Learn and Improve:** Take the time to understand the solutions and code structure. Feel free to experiment, modify, and optimize the code to enhance your React knowledge.
